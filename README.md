My very first programming hackathon in my college where each team of 4 had to do 100 problem statemnets in CPP in 4 days.
These problem statments covered the basics of cpp concepts to OOPS and also a little bit of DSA.
It was a new, thrilling, difficult but fun experience for me where there were no win or lose but only learnings to take away.
We not only had to do code our part of programs but also understand the programs created by our team members, this really helped me adapt to the situation and work as a team.
Happy to share my experience :)
